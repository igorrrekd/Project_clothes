##General Information
The user has things at home that he wants to giveaway of, but does not know how.
There are many solutions available, but many of them require additional effort or are mistrusted. You have to go to the verified places, and there is no time / there is no way to go there, and the containers at home or local collections are unverified and it is not known whether these things will actually go to those in need.
